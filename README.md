# PHP Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP where unexpected behavior can arise from unhandled `null` values. Loose typing can make it easy to miss these issues, leading to bugs that are hard to track down.

The `bug.php` file shows the faulty code. The `bugSolution.php` file demonstrates the correct way to handle `null` values, making the code more robust and preventing unexpected results.

This is a very common error for beginner PHP developers.
